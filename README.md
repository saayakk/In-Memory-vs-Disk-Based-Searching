# In-Memory-vs-Disk-Based-Searching
Explains time efficiency issues associated with In-Memory versus Disk-Based searching strategies.

Implement two different search strategies to try to locate each si from the seek list in the key list:
1. Linear search
2. Binary search

Each of the two searches (linear and binary) will be performed in two different environments. In the first, the key list K will be held completely in memory. In the second, individual elements ki âˆˆ K will read from disk as they are needed.

Execution: assn_1 search-mode keyfile-name seekfile-name
